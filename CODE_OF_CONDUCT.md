## Learning-Focused Environment

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of representing our project include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers responsible for enforcement at [INSERT EMAIL]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Learning-Specific Guidelines

Since TaskFlow is primarily an educational project, we add these specific guidelines:

### For Learners

- **Ask freely**: Your questions help everyone learn
- **Share your struggles**: Others may have the same issues
- **Document your journey**: Your learning process helps others
- **Be patient with yourself**: DevOps is complex; learning takes time

### For Experienced Contributors

- **Be patient**: Remember when you were learning
- **Explain thoroughly**: Don't assume prior knowledge
- **Encourage experimentation**: Safe failures are the best teachers
- **Provide context**: Explain the "why" not just the "how"
- **Suggest resources**: Point learners to documentation and tutorials

---

**Remember**: TaskFlow exists to help people learn DevOps. Let's maintain an environment where everyone feels comfortable asking questions, making mistakes, and growing their skills.

Thank you for helping make TaskFlow a welcoming, educational community! ðŸš€
